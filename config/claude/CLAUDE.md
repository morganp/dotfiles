# Instructions for Claude
Always use specialized agents for all tasks. Do not perform tasks in the main context window.
- **Research/Search:** Always use `@explore` to search the web or file system [5].
- **Coding/Refactoring:** Always use `@code` to generate or modify code [5].
- **Planning:** Use `@plan` to outline complex tasks before executing [5].
- **Context Management:** Ensure sub-agents report back findings, then exit to keep this main conversation focused [1].
